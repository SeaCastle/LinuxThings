# General Setup for Linux AKA: Making sure to install the things I like (because I forget stuff all the time)

## Terminals:
- I like anything that supports 24 bit color. A list of these terminals can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/bed863fb8bedf023b833c88c322e44f9)
- Currently I am using alacritty, which can be found [here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
  If you know what's good for you, you will install dracula theme for your terminal. [Dracula theme found here](https://draculatheme.com/)
  Alacritty has some [pre-made color-schemes](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/wiki/Color-schemes) (which includes dracula :D) Just stick one of these bad boys in your .config/alacritty/alacritty.yml file

## Cmake:
- [cmake](https://cmake.org) is a must have for large C/C++ projects. It seems as of writing this,
the latest release is 3.17.2. Unfortunately if you go for the easy route of running `sudo apt install cmake`,
the version you are gonna get is 3.10.2.
